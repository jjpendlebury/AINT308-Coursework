ABSTRACT={What are the geometric primitives of binocular disparity? The Venetian blind effect and other converging lines of evidence indicate that stereoscopic depth perception derives from disparities of higher-order structure in images of surfaces. Image structure entails spatial variations of intensity, texture, and motion, jointly structured by observed surfaces. The spatial structure of binocular disparity corresponds to the spatial structure of surfaces. Independent spatial coordinates are not necessary for stereoscopic vision. Stereopsis is highly sensitive to structural disparities associated with local surface shape. Disparate positions on retinal anatomy are neither necessary nor sufficient for stereopsis.}

abstract = {Spatial perception refers to the processing and interpretation of the physical relationships between objects, including our bodies. These relationships enable our interactions with single objects (e.g., How do I shape my hand to grasp a mug?) and the larger environment (e.g., How do I get to the store from school?). Perceptual modalities including vision, hearing, and touch apprehend spatial properties. These sensory signals are processed by the brain and used by the motor systems to plan future actions. Because humans are mobile beings, we constantly need to interpret the environment to carry out our motor plans and perform actions.}
